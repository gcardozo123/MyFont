{"name":"Myfont","tagline":"Meu trabalho de graduação em Ciência da Computação - UFSM. Um sistema de fontes para o Odroid-Show. This is my Computer Science course thesis, it's a font system for Odroid-Show.","body":"### Welcome to MyFont Project.\r\nMyFont was my final thesis for the Computer Science bachelor degree at Federal University of Santa Maria - Brazil, it is a font system for [Odroid-Show](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G139781817221). The system is composed by the following programs:\r\n\r\n### MyFont.sln\r\nMyFont.sln is a Visual Studio 2013 solution that comes with 2 projects: **MyFont** and **MyFontGL**, you can use anyone, the only difference is that **MyFontGL** offers a better visual representation (in OpenGL) of the generated glyphs. \r\nEither **MyFont** or **MyFontGL** generates 2 new font files, which are: \"_FontFamilyName_Size_Bit_a_Bit.txt_\" and \"_FontFamilyName_Size_Alternado.txt_\".\r\n\r\n**Input**: a Monospaced TrueType font file. You can find some under MyFont/resources or MyFontGL/resources.\r\n\r\n**Output**: 2 new font files, one for mode Bit a Bit and other for mode Alternado.\r\n\r\n## FontFamilyName_Size_Bit_a_bit.txt\r\nThis is a font file generated by MyFont program.\r\n* 1st line: Header with file that generated this font, size, glyph dimensions and mode.\r\n* 2nd line: Glyph dimensions\r\n* 3rd line: Glyph length\r\n* 4th and subsequent lines: each line is an array of bytes that represent one glyph. The bytes are in decimal representation.\r\n\r\n## FontFamilyName_Size_Alternado.txt\r\nThis is a font file generated by MyFont program.\r\n* 1st line: Header with file that generated this font, size, glyph dimensions and mode.\r\n* 2nd line: Glyph dimensions\r\n* 3rd line: Glyph length\r\n* 4th line: an array of bytes that represent one glyph. The bytes are in decimal representation.\r\n* 5th and subsequent lines: alternates between length of the glyph and the array that represents the glyph itself.\r\n\r\n###Odroid_Stuff\r\n**Odroid_Sketches**: Inside this folder you can find 2 Odroid-Show sketches, one for each font mode (Bi a Bit and Alternado). You need to upload to Odroid-Show the sketch that refers to the font mode you want to use.\r\n\r\n**Adafruit_ILI9340**: This is a modified version of the original Adafruit, it includes methods to print the glyphs that I generated.\r\n\r\n###SerialCom__\r\nThis is a Code::Blocks project used to send glyphs to Odroid-Show. It uses serial communication, which means that you need to set correct serial port being used by Odroid-Show.\r\n\r\n**Input**: a font file generated by MyFont.\r\n\r\n###Project Fluxogram\r\n![This fluxogram represents the information flow in this project.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9798466/11919122/1f9ffb90-a730-11e5-93e3-e1260bca2d4b.PNG)\r\n\r\n###Result\r\n[This is how it looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgDEY2RUzq8)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis repository was created and is kept by Guilherme Recchi Cardozo (@gcardozo123).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n* Email: gcardozo at inf ufsm br\r\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gcardozo123)\r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gcardozo_ )","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
